Sharing the Gospel and Strengthening New and Returning Members,” General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n23.0\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nInviting all to receive the gospel is part of God’s work of salvation and exaltation (see [1.2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation?lang=eng&id=title_number3-p28#title_number3) in this handbook; [Matthew 28:19–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19)). It includes:\n\n*   Participating in missionary work and serving as missionaries.\n    \n*   Helping new and returning Church members progress along the covenant path.\n    \n\n23.1\n\nShare the Gospel\n----------------\n\n![Image 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.churchofjesuschrist.org%2F3e%2Ff0%2F3ef0b05f415e20f45b275e3be54dcda09d297a66%2F3ef0b05f415e20f45b275e3be54dcda09d297a66.jpeg/full/!250,/0/default)\n\n![Image 2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.churchofjesuschrist.org%2Fca%2F2d%2Fca2dba890e0c43e81eb5e1c916d42be08b515b51%2Fca2dba890e0c43e81eb5e1c916d42be08b515b51.jpeg/full/!250,/0/default)\n\n23.1.1\n\n### Love\n\nWe are all children of Heavenly Father, who loves His children perfectly. He offers everyone the opportunity to be filled with His love through Jesus Christ and His gospel (see [John 3:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16); [2 Nephi 26:24–28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p24-p28#p24); [Alma 26:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p37#p37); [Articles of Faith 1:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)).\n\nOne way we show our love for God is by loving and serving His children (see [Matthew 22:36–39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22?lang=eng&id=p36-p39#p36); [25:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p40#p40)). We strive to love and serve as Jesus Christ did. This love inspires us to reach out to people of all religions, races, and cultures (see [Acts 10:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/10?lang=eng&id=p34#p34); [2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)).\n\n23.1.2\n\n### Share\n\nBecause we love God and His children, we naturally want to share the blessings He has given us (see [John 13:34–35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?lang=eng&id=p34-p35#p34)) and help gather Israel. We seek to help people feel the joy that we feel (see [Alma 36:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)). As disciples of Jesus Christ, we hold up His light (see [3 Nephi 18:24–25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p24-p25#p24)). We speak openly of the Savior and His influence in our lives (see [Doctrine and Covenants 60:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)).\n\nWe share love, gospel truths, time, experiences, and Church programs to bless God’s children and help them draw closer to the Savior. We share these things in normal and natural ways as part of personal, online, and other interactions.\n\n23.1.3\n\n### Invite\n\nThe Savior invites all to receive His gospel and prepare for eternal life (see [Alma 5:33–34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p33-p34#p33)). As His disciples, we follow His example, inviting all to “come unto Christ, and be perfected in him” ([Moroni 10:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)).\n\nWe pray for inspiration and guidance on how to invite others to:\n\n*   Come and see the blessings available through Jesus Christ, His gospel, and His Church (see [John 1:37–39, 45–46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1?lang=eng&id=p37-p39,45-p46#p37)).\n    \n*   Come and serve people in need.\n    \n*   Come and belong to the restored Church of Jesus Christ.\n    \n\nWhen our invitations are based on a person’s needs and interests, he or she is more likely to accept those invitations. Often, inviting simply means including our family, friends, and neighbors in what we are already doing. For example, we can invite them to:\n\n*   Join us in our homes for activities.\n    \n*   Join us for worship and gospel learning.\n    \n*   Attend special events, such as a baby blessing or baptism.\n    \n*   Participate in ward and community activities or service, including projects organized through [JustServe.org](http://www.justserve.org/) (where available).\n    \n*   Participate in Church programs and activities. These could include Primary activities, youth activities, family history, self-reliance courses, [BYU–Pathway Worldwide](http://www.byupathway.org/), and literacy and English courses.\n    \n*   Meet the full-time missionaries and hear their message.\n    \n\nFor more ideas and resources, see:\n\n*   [share.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/share).\n    \n*   “[Sharing the Gospel](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/sharing-the-gospel?lang=eng)” in the Gospel Library.\n    \n*   The “[Unite with Members](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/17-chapter-9?lang=eng&id=title16-figure8_p3#title16)” section in chapter 9 of Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n    \n\nWards and stakes can create natural opportunities for members to invite others. Ways to do this include hosting events and activities and sharing Church resources with the local community.\n\nWard and stake leaders counsel together to identify (1) needs in the community and (2) Church resources to share. For more information, see “[Sharing Church Resources](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/sharing-church-resources?lang=eng)” in the Gospel Library.\n\nThe principles of loving, sharing, and inviting apply also to strengthening new and returning members.\n\n23.2\n\nStrengthen New Members\n----------------------\n\nJoining the Church is both wonderful and challenging for many. It brings great blessings, but it also requires adjusting to new beliefs, new habits, and new relationships (see [1 Thessalonians 1:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)).\n\nEach new member needs friendship, opportunities to serve, and spiritual nourishment. As members of the Church, we give new members our love and support (see [Mosiah 18:8–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8)). We help them feel a sense of belonging in the Church. We help them progress along the covenant path and become more deeply “converted unto the Lord” ([Alma 23:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)). We help them be “nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, … relying alone upon the merits of Christ” ([Moroni 6:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)).\n\nWe can also help new members:\n\n*   Learn and experience the joy of being a disciple of Jesus Christ.\n    \n*   Learn how to recognize promptings from the Spirit.\n    \n*   Develop a habit of personal and family prayer and scripture study.\n    \n*   Share the gospel with their family and friends.\n    \n*   Find names of ancestors and prepare to receive temple ordinances for them.\n    \n*   Grow through fulfilling Church assignments and participating in the many other opportunities the Church offers.\n    \n\n23.3\n\nStrengthen Returning Members\n----------------------------\n\nSome members choose to stop participating in the Church. “Unto such,” said the Savior, “shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them” ([3 Nephi 18:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)). These words apply to all who, for any reason, need continued ministering.\n\nMembers who are not fully participating are more likely to return if they have strong relationships with Church members. Our love and support can help them overcome challenges. Like new members, they need friendship, opportunities to serve, and spiritual nourishment. Understanding their circumstances and challenges can help us minister to them with sensitivity and love.\n\n23.4\n\nHold Weekly Coordination Meetings\n---------------------------------\n\nEvery week, brief informal meetings are held to coordinate efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members. If a ward mission leader is called, he conducts these meetings. Otherwise, the member of the elders quorum presidency who fills this role conducts.\n\nOthers who are invited include:\n\n*   Assigned members of the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies.\n    \n*   Ward missionaries.\n    \n*   An assistant in the priests quorum (or the teachers or deacons quorum president if there are no priests in the ward).\n    \n*   A presidency member of the oldest Young Women class.\n    \n*   Full-time missionaries.\n    \n\nWeekly coordination meetings focus on the needs of individuals. This meeting usually covers the following four topics:\n\n*   How to help those being taught by the missionaries. This could include participating in teaching, helping people make and keep commitments, and supporting upcoming baptismal services.\n    \n*   How to help those who were recently baptized\n    \n*   How to help returning members\n    \n*   How to help members find more people to teach\n    \n\nThese meetings may be held in person or remotely. Coordination can also happen in other ways, including phone calls, texts, and emails.\n\n![Image 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.churchofjesuschrist.org%2F94%2Fea%2F94ea44238d7defe712056f812bc9e8a056f3eea5%2F94ea44238d7defe712056f812bc9e8a056f3eea5.jpeg/full/!250,/0/default)\n\n23.5\n\nStake Leaders\n-------------\n\n23.5.1\n\n### Stake Presidency\n\nThe stake president holds the keys in the stake for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. He and his counselors give overall direction for these efforts. He ensures that this work is discussed regularly in stake meetings.\n\nUsually monthly, the stake president meets with the mission president to coordinate efforts between the stake and ward leaders and the full-time missionaries. Others who may attend include:\n\n*   Counselors in the stake and mission presidencies.\n    \n*   Assigned high councilors.\n    \n*   The stake Relief Society president.\n    \n*   Missionaries assigned by the mission president.\n    \n\n23.5.2\n\n### Stake Adult Leadership Committee\n\nThe stake adult leadership committee includes:\n\n*   The stake presidency.\n    \n*   The stake Relief Society presidency.\n    \n*   High councilors assigned to work with elders quorums.\n    \n\nThese leaders instruct and support elders quorum and ward Relief Society presidencies in their efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members (see [23.6.2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number16-p61#title_number16)). Instruction could take place in a group setting or individually. Ward mission leaders may be invited to receive this instruction.\n\nFor more about this committee’s meetings, see [29.3.8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/29-meetings-in-the-church?lang=eng&id=title_number58-p153#title_number58).\n\n23.5.3\n\n### High Councilors\n\nThe stake presidency may assign high councilors to instruct and support elders quorum presidencies and ward mission leaders. One or more high councilors may be assigned to lead these efforts. However, all high councilors have these responsibilities for the wards and quorums to which they are assigned.\n\n23.5.4\n\n### Stake Relief Society Presidency\n\nUnder the direction of the stake president, the stake Relief Society presidency instructs and supports ward Relief Society presidencies in their responsibilities for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members.\n\n23.6\n\nWard Leaders\n------------\n\n23.6.1\n\n### Bishopric\n\nThe bishopric coordinates with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead the ward’s efforts in sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. These leaders counsel together regularly.\n\nThe bishopric ensures that these efforts are discussed and coordinated in ward council and ward youth council meetings. The bishopric also reviews and approves the ward plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members (see [23.6.6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number20-p84#title_number20)).\n\n[](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/0-introductory-overview?lang=eng&id=title_number3#title_number3)The bishopric consults with the stake president to determine whether to call a ward mission leader (see [23.6.3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number17-p68#title_number17) for more information).\n\nThe bishop interviews new members of the appropriate age for a temple recommend to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations (see [26.4.2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/26-temple-recommends?lang=eng&id=title_number14-p49#title_number14)). He also interviews brethren of the appropriate age to receive the Aaronic Priesthood (see [38.2.9.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&id=title_number271-p2815#title_number271)). He normally conducts these interviews within a week of the member’s confirmation.\n\nThe bishopric coordinates with other leaders to ensure that new and returning members have opportunities to serve. Such opportunities can help these members grow spiritually and feel the Lord’s power in their lives. Service can also help members feel joy and build close relationships with others in the ward.\n\nService opportunities should be based on the member’s needs and abilities. In some cases, a calling is appropriate. In others, a less formal assignment is best.\n\n23.6.2\n\n### Elders Quorum and Relief Society Presidencies\n\nThe elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies lead the ward’s day-to-day efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members (see [8.2.3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/8-elders-quorum?lang=eng&id=title_number128-p228#title_number128) and [9.2.3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/9-relief-society?lang=eng&id=title_number10-p163#title_number10)). The elders quorum presidency leads these efforts for members of the elders quorum. The Relief Society presidency leads the efforts for members of the Relief Society. They work together to lead these efforts with the ward council, under the coordination of the bishop.\n\nThese leaders have the following responsibilities:\n\n*   Help inspire members to love God’s children, to share the gospel, and to invite others to receive the Savior’s blessings (see [23.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number3-p22#title_number3)).\n    \n*   Counsel with quorum or Relief Society members about how to share the gospel. Discuss how to find people for the missionaries to teach and how to support people who are being taught. Counsel together about the needs of new and returning members and how to provide support.\n    \n*   Assign ministering brothers and sisters to new and returning members (see [21.2.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/21-ministering?lang=eng&id=title_number6-p65#title_number6)). Ministering brothers and sisters may also be assigned to people the missionaries are teaching (this is done in coordination with the missionaries). If possible, leaders assign members who have or can develop close friendships with these individuals. Leaders encourage ministering brothers and sisters to give Christlike love and support.\n    \n*   Give new and returning members opportunities to serve as ministering sisters or brothers. For more about ministering, see [chapter 21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/21-ministering?lang=eng).\n    \n*   Help the ward council develop a plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members (see [23.6.6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number20-p84#title_number20)).\n    \n*   Lead the work of the ward mission leader. If this leader is not called, a member of the elders quorum presidency fills this role (see [23.6.3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number17-p68#title_number17)).\n    \n\nThe elders quorum president and Relief Society president each assign a presidency member to help lead these efforts. These two presidency members work together. They attend weekly coordination meetings (see [23.4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number21-p97#title_number21)).\n\n23.6.3\n\n### [Image icon, guidelines for adaptation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/0-introductory-overview?lang=eng&id=title_number3#title_number3)Ward Mission Leader\n\nThe bishopric consults with the stake president to determine whether to call a ward mission leader. If they decide to extend this calling, the bishopric counsels with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents in determining whom to call.\n\nThe ward mission leader should be a Melchizedek Priesthood holder. If a ward mission leader is not called, a member of the elders quorum presidency fills this role.\n\nThe ward mission leader supports the elders quorum presidency and Relief Society presidency in their missionary responsibilities. He also has the following responsibilities:\n\n*   Coordinate the work of ward members and leaders, ward missionaries, and full-time missionaries. This may include coordinating teaching efforts, baptismal services, and efforts to strengthen new members. It can also include planning ways to help ward members share the gospel.\n    \n*   Lead weekly coordination meetings (see [23.4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number21-p97#title_number21)).\n    \n*   Attend ward council meetings when invited.\n    \n*   Help the ward council develop and implement the ward plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members (see [23.6.6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number20-p84#title_number20)).\n    \n*   Seek opportunities to help full-time missionaries fulfill their purpose by sharing the gospel and building relationships with members. Where approved, this may include eating meals with members (preferably with part-member families and new and returning members when possible; see [24.6.2.3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/24?lang=eng&id=title_number36-p179#title_number36)).\n    \n*   Work with the ward temple and family history leader and consultants to help those who are learning the gospel, new members, and returning members engage in temple and family history work.\n    \n\n23.6.4\n\n### Ward Missionaries\n\nWard missionaries help ward members experience the joy of sharing the gospel as described in [23.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number3-p22#title_number3). They serve under the direction of the ward mission leader or the member of the elders quorum presidency who fills this role. The elders quorum and Relief Society presidents may suggest members who could serve.\n\nWard missionaries teach by word and example how to love others, share their faith, and invite others to receive the blessings of the gospel. They also help ward members minister to new and returning members.\n\nWard missionaries participate in weekly coordination meetings (see [23.4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/23?lang=eng&id=title_number21-p97#title_number21)).\n\n23.6.5\n\n### Ward Council and Ward Youth Council\n\nSharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members should be discussed regularly in ward council meetings. The bishop may ask the elders quorum or Relief Society president to lead these discussions, which should focus on individuals. The bishop may invite the ward mission leader to attend ward council meetings.\n\nThe council may discuss the ward’s plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. They also discuss assignments that need to be coordinated across organizations. Resources like the following can help in these discussions:\n\n*   [My Covenant Path](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/adults/new-or-returning-members?lang=eng). This resource helps new and returning members progress along the covenant path during the first 12 to 24 months after baptism or after returning to gospel participation. [My Covenant Path](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/adults/new-or-returning-members?lang=eng) is available in Gospel Library.\n    \n*   Covenant Path Progress record. Ward leaders and full-time missionaries use this resource to record and view the progress of new and returning members and of people being taught by the missionaries. Covenant Path Progress is available to ward leaders through the Member Tools app and [Leader and Clerk Resources](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/) (LCR). Full-time missionaries access and share information from Covenant Path Progress through the Preach My Gospel app.\n    \n\nFor more about the ward council, see [29.2.5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/29-meetings-in-the-church?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p54#title_number8).\n\nThe ward youth council gives special attention to (1) youth who are new and returning members and (2) youth being taught by the missionaries. The council also discusses ways the youth can participate in the ward’s plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening all new and returning members. For more about the ward youth council, see [29.2.6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/29-meetings-in-the-church?lang=eng&id=title_number9-p63#title_number9).\n\n23.6.6\n\n### Ward Plan for Sharing the Gospel and Strengthening New and Returning Members\n\nEach ward should have a simple plan for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members. This plan can help guide meetings, service, and activities. It can include plans and ideas for:\n\n*   Helping everyone feel welcome in ward meetings and activities.\n    \n*   Helping members experience the joy of sharing the gospel.\n    \n*   Supporting people being taught by the missionaries.\n    \n*   Helping new and returning members progress spiritually.\n    \n\nThe elders quorum and Relief Society presidents help the ward council create the plan. The ward mission leader also helps. The bishop reviews and approves it.\n\nMembers of the ward council take the lead in implementing the plan. They report on progress in ward council meetings. They also update the plan as needed.","links":{"Handbooks and Callings":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/handbooks-and-callings?lang=eng","Contents":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook?lang=eng","Title Page":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/title-page?lang=eng","Summary of Recent Updates":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/summary-of-recent-updates?lang=eng","16.

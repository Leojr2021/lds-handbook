The first of these is living the gospel of Jesus Christ. We live the gospel as we:\n\n*   Exercise faith in Jesus Christ.\n    \n*   Repent daily.\n    \n*   Make covenants with God as we receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation.\n    \n*   Endure to the end by keeping those covenants.\n    \n\nLiving the gospel encompasses the other aspects of God’s work of salvation and exaltation. These include caring for those in need, inviting all to receive the gospel, and uniting families for eternity.\n\nPrint\n-----","links":{"Handbooks and Callings":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/handbooks-and-callings?lang=eng","Contents":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook?lang=eng","Title Page":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/title-page?lang=eng","Summary of Recent Updates":"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/summary-of-recent-updates?lang=eng","16.
